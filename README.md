# TelegramBot Library


A project by [Casa Jasmina](http://casajasmina.arduino.cc/)

## Introduction

This library provides an interface for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

It is possible to define your personal Bot, make it able to read and write messages, receive orders and report data collected from the field.

## Installing

The downloaded code can be included as a new library into the IDE selecting the menu:

     Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library

You also have to install the ArduinoJson library written by [Beno√Æt Blanchon](https://github.com/bblanchon).
Available [here](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson).


## Getting started

View the last released Telegram API documentation at: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api.

To generate your new Bot, you need an Access Token. Talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
